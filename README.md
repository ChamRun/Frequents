## Who used this word? How many times?


This python code reads an Excel file about requests and searches for a keyword in the data frame to see how many people used that specific word in their requests.

You can use the demo version on [Frequents Telegram Bot](https://t.me/FrequentsBot).

This project was supposed to be my second freelancing project, but the client changed his mind at the start of the project and regretted it, so I did it just for learning and fun :D
